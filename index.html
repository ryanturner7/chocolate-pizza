    <p> Use good HTML structure to scaffold this site. Reminders: Container elements (a box outside of your content box that might contain multiple content boxes) are very useful in managing layout. You will need to think about the relationship between parent and child / descendant elements as well as the order in which you place them in the HTML. Keep in mind that you can use display: inline in your CSS to force block elements, which would ordinarily stack, to sit side-by-side. Be thoughtful about your CSS layout strategy. </p>
  <p>Use CSS to style the page to reflect the full comp image provided as closely as possible. Use what knowledge you have at this point (and any resources you are able to understand and use effectively from other sources) to style your site as closely to the design comp as you can: fonts, colors, layout, all of it. You have the resources and are aware of online tools which will help you find useful solutions! On a project like this, something that finishes the basic task is the goal... it can always be refactored with better design and code later. There are no right or wrong answers... just do your best. </p>
<p> OPTIONAL: Add some JavaScript functionality! Get creative, but make sure the style is complete before moving onto any additional features. Wouldn't it be neato if you could actually check those checkboxes? </p>
